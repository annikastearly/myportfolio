          About me:
        </div>
        My name is Annika Stearly. I was born on June 30th, 2005 on Martha's Vineyard, a vacation island off the coast
        of Massachusetts. I was adopted at birth and given to my parents almost seconds after I was born. I grew up in a
        small town in Northern Massachusetts, and I have lived there ever since.I do not have any siblings, but I grew
        up with many dogs in the family. My parents are both very talented artists, my dad has worked as a tattoo artist
        most of my life, and before that he was a portrait painter. My mom has worked part-time as an art teacher for as
        long as I can remember. I am currently 17 years old, and I am a full time student, I play the piano, and I
        parttake in freelance modeling gigs when I can.

          Education:
        </div>
        Growing up in North Billerica, I attended the Hajjar Elementary School from grades 1st through 4th. Before that,
        I attended daycare at a daycare in Wilmington, MA. In the summer before my 5th grade year, my mom had entered my
        name in the lottery for Innovation Academy Charter School in Tyngsborough, MA. I was chosen, and began attending
        there as a 5th grader, which is the earliest grade at that school. I stayed there for all of middle school and
        highschool, making it a whole 8 years of education that led me to my graduating year; 2023.

          Future:
        </div>
        In the upcoming years I plan on graduating,attending a liberal arts college in Boston to study journalism,film,
        performance arts and possibly some political science too. I may also finish up my training for becoming a tattoo
        artist so I will be able to do that on
        the side during college and then wherever I go.
